# Instructions for Codex agents

- Follow SPEC.md as the source of truth.
- Prefer small, testable changes.
- Add unit tests for parser and runtime behavior.
- Keep v0 dynamic types; do not implement a full typechecker yet.
- Avoid adding new dependencies unless necessary.
- WASM bindings must be minimal and stable.
- UI can be basic (textarea + run button + render JSON).
